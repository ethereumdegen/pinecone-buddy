Best Approach for Vectorizing a Rust Bevy Project

File Filtering & Preprocessing

Filter out binary files, build artifacts, and dependencies
Focus on .rs source files, configuration files, and documentation
Remove commented code and unnecessary whitespace to reduce noise


Chunking Strategy

Chunk by semantic units rather than arbitrary character counts
For Rust code, consider chunking by:

Functions/methods
Structs/enums/traits
Modules


Maintain context by including function signatures with implementations


Embedding Generation

Use a code-specific embedding model if possible (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large or CodeBERT)
Generate embeddings for each semantic chunk
Include file path metadata with each embedding


Metadata Enhancement

Store critical metadata alongside embeddings:

File path
Line numbers
Dependencies between files
Component/system relationships (important for Bevy ECS)


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Implement a parallel storage system: Most production implementations use a dual-storage approach:

Store embeddings in Pinecone for semantic search capabilities
Store the original text chunks in a separate database (like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or even a simple file system)
Include an ID with each vector in Pinecone that maps to the corresponding full text in your secondary storage
